## Objectives

* Students will review concepts taught through the previous lessons and have an opportunity to fill any gaps they may have

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students should feel comfortable with the concepts necessary to build responsive front ends

### Teacher Note

This day may need to be dynamic in terms of content.  What students need to review will dictate the topics. Some important topics that should be discussed:

* DOM Manipulation in conjunction with CSS
* JavaScript Fundamentals
* Async methods
* Project Development - Ideation, Design, Planning and Execution

This may also be a good day for students to complete any labs and lessons they may have not gotten to, or to have them go back to some labs that they struggled with to see if they have a better understanding now.
